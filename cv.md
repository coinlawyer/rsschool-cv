I have done my graduation in Law and been working as a lawyer for about 15 years but I always had a passion to the computers and everythign that is connected with how they work. 
Recently I started learning front-end development from a scratch, and now my goal is to get proficient development skills and to become a T-sharp experienced JavaScript developer, 
get a deep experience in software developing, participating in real projects and, finally, to get a work position in this area.
I believe that my passion to learning and ability to learn fast will help a lot in gaining my goal. 
I have basic skills of: GIT, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and React.

5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
