	I have done my graduation in law and have been working as a lawyer for about 15 years, but I always had a passion to the computers and everythign that was connected with them. 
Recently I started learning front-end development from a scratch and now my goal is to get proficient development skills and to become a t-sharp web developer, 
with a deep experience in software developing, participating in real projects and, finally, to get a work position in this area.
I believe that my passion to learning and ability to learn fast will help a lot in gaining my goal.
